# Overview:

It consist of 2 ads categories:

* => **Banner ads**
* => **Text ads**

The banner campaign was divided into three sub classes:

* **360px by 114px**

* **300px by 250px**

* **300px by 600px**

To accommodate for both the banner and text ads, a 16 x 1 matrix system was employed. The 16 x 1 matrix system simply means that each sections of the community had 16 possible slots for active advertisement. This implied that each sections could only display a maximum of 16 active ads at its peak time.

The 16 slots were allocated per section as follows:

* **360px x 114px banner ads took 6 slots**

* **300px x 250px banner ads took 2 slots**

* **300px x 600px banner ads took 2 slots**

* **Text ads took 6 slots**

The system was designed to be very impartial and ensured that ads were filled into the 16 slots according to the placement time. Since the system filled up the 16 available slots by sorting ads in a section base on their placement time, removing an ad from a section for example and placing it back to that same section will definitely put the ad at the bottom of the sort queue.
